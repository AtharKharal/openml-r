Stage 3 - Uploading
===================

### Upload an implementation using mlr

A flows is an implementation of single algorithms or script. To create an implementation, we can use the `mlr` package. Each `mlr` learner can be considered as an implementation of a flow that can be uploaded to the server with the function `uploadOMLFlow`.
If the implementation is already was already been uploaded to the server, we get a message that the flow already exists and the `implementation.id` is returned from the function. Otherwise, the not existing flow is uploaded and a new `implementation.id` is assigned to it.

```{r eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = TRUE}
library(mlr)
lrn = makeLearner("classif.randomForest")
implementation.id = uploadOMLFlow(lrn, session.hash = session.hash) 
implementation.id
```
