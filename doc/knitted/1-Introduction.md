Introduction
============

The R package OpenML is an interface to make interactions with the OpenML server as comfortable as possible. Users can download and upload files, run their implementations on specific tasks, get
predictions in the correct form, run SQL queries, etc. directly via R commands. In this tutorial, we
will show you the most important functions of this package and give you examples on standard
workflows.

For general information on what [OpenML](http://openml.org/) is, please have a look at the
[Readme file](https://github.com/openml/OpenML/blob/master/README.md).
