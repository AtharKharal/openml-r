1) Building, installing, checking the package
Every build step can be accomplished via the MAKEFILE. 
Please type "make" to see all available targets.
Most common:
  make install
  make check


2) OO system
S4 is used. 

3) Naming conventions and code style.
Code indentation:
  Always use two spaces for every level. TABs should be converted to spaces.
Assigments: 
  use "<-".
General function names: 
  Camel case, first character lower-case, "doThisThing", "taskType"
Function arguments, local vars, slot names, list elements in results: 
  words separated by dots (.), lower-case.
S4 class names: 
  Camel case, first character upper-case.
S4 constructors:
  Same name as S4 class
Accessors:
  Only write accessors for more complicated things, not for stuff the user can get by simply doing foo@bar.

4) Documentation.
Currently done by directly writing Rd file.
Maybe later switch to roxygen2.

5) Argument checking.
In basic R function can be simply done via BBmisc::checkArg.
Dont do this in smaller helper function which are called extremely often for speed reasons.

6) TODOs and FIXMEs
General TODOs should go into todo.txt (maybe later in the issue tracker on github).
Smaller, concrete problems with code must be tagged with a #FIXME comment.

7) Unit test
Implemented with testthat.
Can be run with "make test" which also automatically builds the package before.
"make check" also runs them as the last step in R CMD check.
